**FedALA-SA** is a cutting-edge framework extending **FedALA** with Structure-Aware capabilities, designed to tackle the heterogeneity in Federated Graph Learning (FGL). By integrating topological insights and privacy-preserving mechanisms, FedALA-SA offers a robust solution for decentralized graph data analysis.

## Key Features

*   **Structure-Aware Aggregation**: Leverages graph topology (Degree & Layer-wise) to optimize model updates.
*   **Privacy-First Design**: Integrated Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms (Gaussian Noise) for secure collaboration.
*   **Scalable Architecture**: Tested and validated on scalable client setups (10-20+ clients).
*   **Automated Benchmarking**: One-click reproduction of baseline vs. innovation scenarios.
*   **Visual Analytics**: Automatic generation of convergence curves and ablation study plots.

## Installation

Get started in minutes! Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mertcoskuner/FedALA-SA.git
cd FedALA-SA
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
We have prepared a `requirements.txt` with all necessary packages (including CUDA-enabled PyTorch).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** If you are using a specific CUDA version (e.g., CUDA 11.8), the `requirements.txt` already handles the extra index URL for PyTorch.

## Usage

### Run the Main Benchmark
Execute the comprehensive benchmark script to reproduce the paper's results (Baseline vs. FedALA-SA vs. Privacy):

```bash
python run_fedala_sa.py
```

**What this does:**
*   Runs 3 critical scenarios:
    1.  **Baseline**: Vanilla FedALA
    2.  **Innovation**: FedALA-SA (Structure-Aware)
    3.  **Privacy**: FedALA-SA + Differential Privacy
*   Tests scalability (10 vs 20 Clients).
*   Saves results to `fedala_sa_final_results.csv`.
*   Generates plots (`fedala_sa_ablation_study.png`, `fedala_sa_convergence_*.png`).

## Results

Experimental outputs, including detailed logs for all benchmark scenarios (Baseline, FedALA-SA, and Privacy), per-client statistics, loss/accuracy metrics, and round-by-round summaries are recorded in [slurm_sa_355368.out](./slurm_sa_355368.out). 

By examining this file, you can trace the evolution of model performance, compare experimental configurations, and verify the reproducibility of the results reported in the paper. For convenience, you may wish to search for keywords such as `accuracy_test`, `best_val_accuracy`, or specific scenario names within the log to locate key results.
